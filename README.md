# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
Data visualization is accessible by using JavaScript to render data about bacteria that tastes like beef.  Data is available per test subjects ID and shows graphs that visualize information such as: 1) bar chart: Top 10 OTUs(bacteria), 2) gauge chart: Belly Button Washing Frequency, and 3) bubble chart: Belly Button Bacterias.

## Charts
Each chart is created using JavaScript to show details of the test subjects demographic information, top 10 OTUs, belly button washing frequency, and belly button bacterias.  

### Demographic Information Panel
To use test subject ID No 940 as an example, when selected from the dropdown menu, demographic information is provided(e.g. ethnicity,gender, age, location).

The belly button bar chart shows that OTU 1167 is the OTU that has the highest bacteria sample value in her belly button.  Washing frequency gauge chart increased to show that she washes her belly button two times a week.  The bubble chart displays all the bacterias that are in her belly button and the size of the marker increase depending on the amount there is.   

## Summary
Using Javascript, data visualization was created to help determine which bacteria is most commonly in humans belly button and also tastes like beef.
